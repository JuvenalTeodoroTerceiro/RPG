                <b>Fire Rune</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, <strong>your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.</strong>
                        The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Cloud Rune</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. <strong>While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks. In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. </strong>
                        The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                <b>Retornar Folego:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, <strong>you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</strong>
                        Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Action Surge:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li> Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. <strong>On your turn, you can take one additional action</strong>.
                        Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</li>
